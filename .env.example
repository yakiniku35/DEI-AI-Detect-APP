# NEXTAUTH_URL is safe for local development. Do NOT deploy with NEXTAUTH_URL pointing
# to localhost. In production set NEXTAUTH_URL to your app's canonical URL (https://your-domain)
# or rely on Vercel's VERCEL_URL environment variable which is automatically provided
# in serverless environments (we prefer explicitly setting NEXTAUTH_URL in Vercel envs).
