## Remaining Deprecation Warnings

The following deprecation warnings remain from transitive dependencies:
- `eslint@8.57.1` - ESLint v8 is deprecated, but Next.js 14.2.18 only supports ESLint v7-v8
- `inflight@1.0.6` - Used by transitive dependencies
- `rimraf@3.0.2` - Used by transitive dependencies
- `glob@7.2.3` - Used by transitive dependencies
- `@humanwhocodes/config-array` and `@humanwhocodes/object-schema` - Used by ESLint v8

These warnings cannot be resolved without upgrading to Next.js 15.x, which would be a major version upgrade.

## Note on ESLint v9

The original PR description requested ESLint v9.15.0, however:
- Next.js 14.2.18 only supports ESLint v7 and v8
- ESLint v9 support was added in Next.js 15.0.0
- To maintain compatibility with Next.js 14.x, ESLint 8.57.1 (last stable v8 release) was used

To upgrade to ESLint v9, you would need to also upgrade to Next.js 15.x.

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
